# Re-Prep: Simplifying Fleet Maintenance on Performance Vehicles
Re-Prep is a web application designed to bring fleet maintenance of performance-built vehicles into the 21st century. By integrating features such as vehicle status monitoring, parts inventory management, custom maintenance intervals, and cost visualization, Re-Prep allows users to keep track of their vehicles in an efficient and user-friendly way. 

Re-Prep was designed to be a solution to help users save money and have their fingers on the pulse of their performance fleet. While there are lots of options for fleet management software for taxis, buses, semi-trucks, and other normal fleets, there is no fleet management software that is performance or race focused. Re-Prep solves that problem by providing a highly customizable service that users can tailor to their needs. I am in a unique situation to design Re-Prep as a mechanic at a performance driving school and use my experience and contacts within the industry to design a robust and intuitive system.

Built with Python, FastAPI, React, Next.js and MySQL as the main libraries, frameworks, and languages, the system is designed to be scalable, secure, and robust. Key features include digital tracking of maintenance records, analytics of individual vehicles, and individual parts tracking on individual vehicles, and a smart inventory system. Re-Prep aims to enhance user workflow efficiency and improve fleet health, all while saving users money on unnecessary repairs, repeat diagnostic time, and reducing downtime.
